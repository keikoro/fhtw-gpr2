TODO
----

*create 1 labyrinth class
- contains the maze vector
- (saves positions of all robots -> could to this in the robots class too)
- has to know its own size
- has a function for adding a new instance of robots (in practice of 
	t1, t2, t3) into a list
- a list of pointers to robots

*create 1 robot class
- with 3 sub classes (for 3 different kinds of "search" behaviours/algorithms)
- variable for saving the character used by the robot to mark its way
- function for the search algoritm
- needs to communicate with the labyrinth class to
	a. determine whether is has a wall in front of itself
	b. for its own position (?)

*output maze, maybe move this to a method

*create Makefile DONE

*free all the space allocated with malloc before the program closes

-----

Command to run the program:
labrob DATEINAME [-t1] [–t2] [–t3]...[-tN] [-h]

-t1-tN is the robot type (if no type is specified, use t1)
-h outputs a usage message

-----

Unclear:
We only need to define 3 robot types;
what is supposed to happen when user enters -tN?
