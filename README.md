# FHTW GPR2

C and C++ scripts.   
Homework for my CS studies, summer term 2014. [incomplete]


## Usage 

All code – C as well as CPP code – can be compiled by running the `Makefile` in its containing directory:

```
$ make
```

The resulting executables are run with:

```
$ ./executable
```

<br>
To clean the directories of files created during compilation (including executables), run:

```
$ make clean
```


<br>
Executables include:

`labrob`  
`sortnames`  
`griddisplay`, `gridserver`, `vehicleclient`
