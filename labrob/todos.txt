TODO:

- create 1 labyrinth class
saves positions of all robots
has to know its own size
includes function to find entrance

- create 1 robot class
with 3 sub classes (for 3 different kinds of "search" behaviours/algorithms)

- read maze file
- output maze

command to run program:
labrob DATEINAME [-t1] [–t2] [–t3]...[-tN] [-h]

-t1-tN is the robot type (if no type is specified, use t1)
-h outputs a usage message

Unclear: We only need to define 3 robot types; what is supposed to happen when user enters -tN?
