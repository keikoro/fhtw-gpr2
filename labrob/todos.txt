TODO:

- create 1 labyrinth class
contains the maze vector (?)
saves positions of all robots
has to know its own size
includes function to find entrance (or put this into the robots search algoritm 
instead - what if the first opening leads to a dead end?)

- create 1 robot class
with 3 sub classes (for 3 different kinds of "search" behaviours/algorithms)
variable for saving the character used by the robot to mark its way
function for the search algoritm (we do not need to implement functions themselves yet)
needs to communicate with the labyrinth class to
	a. determine whether is has a wall in front of itself
	b. for its own position (?)

- read maze file
- output maze

command to run program:
labrob DATEINAME [-t1] [–t2] [–t3]...[-tN] [-h]

-t1-tN is the robot type (if no type is specified, use t1)
-h outputs a usage message

Unclear: We only need to define 3 robot types; what is supposed to happen when user enters -tN?

-classes need to be put into header-files; create makefile
